# Nixtamalization Moisture Content Prediction in a Maize Inbred Diversity Panel

## Purpose:
Food-grade maize (specifically maize used for producing tortillas and tortilla chips) is a small usage and production segment of
commercial maize in the United States. Due to this, food-grade maize breeding programs do not typically have the resources to 
develop tools for breeding platforms specific to food-grade purposes. One trait of interest is nixtamalization moisture
content, which is the amount of water absorbed by kernels during the nixtamalization process. Nixtamalization involves cooking 
maize kernels in an alkaline solution at high temperatures to remove the pericarp and soften the grain for grinding. 
The moisture content of the resulting masa affects its taste, texture, oil content, and more making it an important trait for 
food-grade maize. Multiple methods have been proposed for assessing nixtamalization moisture content, however, they tend to focus
on the manufacturing process and require anywhere from 100g to 1,000 lbs of seed. This is not a viable option in early maize breeding pipelines
where large numbers of small-quantity samples are present. To address this, we utilized Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined 
with machine learning to develop a high-throughput method for predicting moisture content during nixtamalization. By training a 
machine learning model on NIR spectra and nixtamalization moisture content data we were able to train an accurate (Spearman R = 0.85) model on only 30g 
of grain per sample. This model was then used to analyze trait variation and genetic factors. The study's approach offers a rapid and scalable solution for 
evaluating nixtamalization moisture content, providing valuable insights for improving food-grade maize germplasm and informing 
breeding strategies for masa-based products.
