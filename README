Description of code files found in this repository:

Cleaning_Kernel_Comp_Data.Rmd
  An R markdown file going through each of the steps from reading in a csv file to cleaning it of outliers 
  (as of 1/8/2020, this is set to 3 standard deviations). It will also export the final cleaned version as a csv.

Data_Partioner.R
  R script that utilizes the caret program in R to create a training and test dataset of a given size.  Change p to an 
  appropriate partition rate.  It will allow you to read in a csv file and will export both the training and test set as csv 
  files to read into other algorithms.  It is recommended to clean the data set of outliers and duplicates before using this.
  
Duplicate_Remover.R
  R script that will look through a dataset with a SampleID column and check to see if any of the names match the one before
  it.  The dataset will need to be sorted before feeding into this program (as of 1/8/2020).  It will remove duplicate lines
  that were scanned after their counterparts.  Note: it has not been attempted on a file that doesn't have a column for 
  analysis.time, and it will not work if the names are not exactly the same (case sensitive, space sensitive, etc).
