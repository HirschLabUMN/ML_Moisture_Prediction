    - A file of scans that is needed to ensure the model is still predicting as it originally did
  Moisture_Uptake_Master_Dataset_Cook_Macro_Spectra.csv
    - The training dataset
  Moisture_Uptake_Prediction_Model.R
    - R script with the prediction model function
  Prediction_Model_Setup.R
    - R script to set up the local environment for the prediction model
  Validation_Set_Predictions.csv

Instructions:
- Clone the github folder to a preferred location on your computer
- From the command line, enter into the folder Manuscript_Code/Moisture_Uptake_Prediction/
- Run the R script Moisture_Uptake_Prediction_Model.R using: Rscript Moisture_Uptake_Prediction_Model.R
  - This script will source the setup script.
- 
  - It will take about a minute for the setup script to run, but once it has, it will not need to again until a new R environment is created.
