Contents:
  ML_Master_Validation_Dataset.csv
    - A file of scans that is needed to ensure the model is still predicting as it originally did
  Moisture_Uptake_Master_Dataset_Cook_Macro_Spectra.csv
    - The training dataset
  Moisture_Uptake_Prediction_Model.R
    - R script with the prediction model function
  Prediction_Model_Setup.R
    - R script to set up the local environment for the prediction model
  Validation_Set_Predictions.csv
    - A file saved with original validation set predictions to compare current predictions to inorder to ensure the model hasn't changed

----------

Data format:
- The script will normalize the data after reading it in
- The first column of the data should be "Sample_ID"
- There should be 141 columns in addition to "Sample_ID" that are waveband absorbances from 950nm to 1650nm, in increments of 5nm.

Instructions:
- Clone the github folder to a preferred location on your computer.
- Open the file Moisture_Uptake_Prediction_Model.R in RStudio.
  - It can be found in the Manuscript_Code/Moisture_Uptake_Prediction/ directory.
- In the top right corner of the script window of RStudio, press the "source" button.
- In the console window of RStudio, type: Moisture_Uptake_Prediction().
  - This will source the setup file.
  - The first time running in a new R environment will take about a minute as it needs to train the model.
    - This will happen each time if R is closed in between uses.
- There will be a prompt in the console window of R studio asking for an input file path, write out the file path to the data you want to create predictions on.
  - It is usually easiest to enclose your file path in double quotes so R will help you autocomplete your file paths.
- There will be a prompt in the console window of R studio asking for an output file path, write out the file path to the location and file name you want for your output dataset.
- The function will output your original dataset with an additional column of Moisture Uptake Predicitons.
